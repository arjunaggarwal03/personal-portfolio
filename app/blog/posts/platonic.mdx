3D rendering is a fundamental aspect of computer graphics, involving the transformation of three-dimensional points into two-dimensional coordinates. I provide visualizations of this process by applying projection and rotation matrices to four platonic solids: cube, octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron.

## The Concept Behind Platonic Rotation

3D rendering is a classic example of applied linear algebra where three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) are mapped to two-dimensional coordinates (x, y) via transformation matrices. Using OpenCV, I simulated the application of projection and rotation matrices to four platonic solids, showcasing their rotations in real-time.

## What Platonic Rotation Does

I used OpenCV's built-in functions `line(...)` and `circle(...)` along with the `Mat` array class. The following animation provides an example of the rotations:

## The Math

### Step One: Rotation

To rotate the 3D coordinates, each x-y-z coordinate is converted into a 1x3 matrix and then multiplied by the rotation matrices. Here are the rotation matrices used:

These matrices, along with the three-dimensional coordinate matrix, are represented in my code as two-dimensional vectors:

```cpp
vector<vector<float>> rotationX{{1,0,0},{0,cos(angle),-sin(angle)},{0,sin(angle),cos(angle)}};
vector<vector<float>> rotationY{{cos(angle),0,-sin(angle)},{0,1,0},{sin(angle),0,cos(angle)}};
vector<vector<float>> rotationZ{{cos(angle),-sin(angle),0},{sin(angle),cos(angle),0},{0,0,1}};
```

The order of multiplication affects the rotation animation. In my code, the rotation sequence is first along the Y axis, then the X axis, and finally the Z axis:

```cpp
vector<vector<float>> rotated = matmul(rotationY, points[i]); // rotates along Y axis
rotated = matmul(rotationX, rotated); // then rotates along X axis
rotated = matmul(rotationZ, rotated); // finally rotates along Z axis
```

### Step Two: Orthographic Projection

Finally, the 1x3 x-y-z coordinate matrix is converted into two-dimensional coordinates using the orthographic projection matrix:

The orthogonal projection matrix is represented in my code as follows:

```cpp
vector<vector<float>> projection{{1,0,0},{0,1,0}};
```

## Running the Code (for Mac/Linux)

To run the code, you need to have OpenCV set up on your personal computer. Refer to [this guide](https://medium.com/@jaskaranvirdi/setting-up-opencv-and-c-development-environment-in-xcode-b6027728003) for OpenCV installation instructions. Ensure that your `opencv.pc` file is located in your `pkgconfig` folder.

Compile the code by navigating to the cloned repository in the terminal and running:

```sh
g++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv) -std=c++11 [name of file].cpp -o run
```

Then, run the program with:

```sh
./run
```

## Conclusion

Creating a command line shell is a fundamental exercise for understanding operating systems and system programming. I embarked on this project to develop a Unix-like command line shell in C, aiming to implement core features such as boolean operations, pipes, and file redirection.

## Development and Features

The shell I developed supports complex command structures through efficient CLI tokenization. By constructing a tree data structure, the shell can parse and execute commands effectively. This structure allows for advanced functionalities such as boolean operations and piping, essential for robust command line interfaces.

## Optimization with Makefile

To ensure the build process is optimized, I created a comprehensive Makefile. This file includes clear dependency rules that expedite compilation, making the development process smoother and more efficient.

## Conclusion

Developing a Unix-like command line shell in C was an enlightening experience that deepened my understanding of system-level programming. This project highlights the importance of efficient parsing and execution mechanisms, providing a solid foundation for further exploration in operating systems and system software.
